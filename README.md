Moth-Flame Optimizer solving TSP with SFML visualization in C++
# MFO-TSP-SFML

This project implements the Moth-Flame Optimizer (MFO) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using C++ and SFML for interactive visualizations.

## Features

- MFO-based TSP solution
- Accurate geographic distance using Haversine formula
- SFML visualization of:
  - Distance matrix
  - City graph and best path
  - Distance optimization progress
- Saves performance data in CSV

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- [SFML Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
